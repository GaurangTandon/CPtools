# C++ vs Java - which language to use?

### Pros for C++

1. Excellent support for `#define` and `typedef` to define short acronyms, Java has none.
2. Wider community support, more people use it.

### Pros for Java

1. Excellent safety: greater number of error messages and exceptions, no chance of undefined behavior, makes debugging much easier.

If I can integrate java with vscode, I might get rid of those typedef problems.
But there was a java code on codechef for one problem it was giving an NZEC and idk why Look it up once
