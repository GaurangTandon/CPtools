# CP tools

An actively updated collection of the tools I use in CP. Outlines these important details:

1. `tips.md`: which contains common mistakes that I mostly did while coding.
2. `snippets/snippets.json`: which contains the snippets I used in VS Code. This is mostly for archival purposes as I no longer use VS Code for competitive coding. I intend to outline competitive coding setup in Vim in near future. Moreover, you can find updated snippets in the [algorithms notebook](https://github.com/AnimeshSinha1309/AlgorithmsNotebook/)
3. `onekeycodeexecution.md`: faster code compilation and running for editors.
4. `CppVsJava.md`: because why not? :P
