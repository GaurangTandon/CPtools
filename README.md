# CP Resources

CP resources a **quick reference guide** and an **FAQ helper** for competitive coders at all levels.


<!-- You will not find answers to questions like "How to dfs on a graph?", but you _will_ find answers to "What are some common graph algorithms at beginner level?". -->

## Contribute

This is an open source project, all PRs are welcome.

## Development

A remote server (kindly provided by our institute, IIIT Hyderabad) runs a cronjob every half an hour to fetch the latest code on master branch, builds the Jekyll website, and serves it on the URL.

## Continuous integration

Test files (in `test` directory) ensure improper Markdown files fail the Travis build.
